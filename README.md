# Skorokhod-Metric
Compute the Skorokhod distance between traces.


The procedure for computing the Skorokhod distance between two piecewise constant traces is in the directory PiecewiseConstant.
The procedure for deciding whether the Skorokhod distance between two polygonal  (piecewise constant and continuous) traces  is at most some given delta  is in the directory Polygonal. The Skorokhod distance can be found by a binary search procedure using this routine.

Each directory has a README.txt file, and a makefile for compilation.

Tested on Debian
